## Setup

1. Install [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) on your computer.

2. Make sure that the file `oc-transpo-gps-bus-tracker.rb` is in your BitBar plugin folder.
3. If the script does not run and provides the error: `launch path not accessible`, make sure to run the following in a terminal:

```
chmod +x ~/this/is/an/example/directory/path/to/my/file.rb
```
